# ðŸŽ° Slot Machine Project

This is a simple console-based **Slot Machine Game** built using Python. The project demonstrates core programming concepts such as functions, loops, conditionals, random number generation, and user input handling.

## ðŸ§¾ Features

- Allows users to deposit money.
- Bet on 1 to 4 lines simultaneously.
- Customize bet amount per line.
- Symbols are randomly spun across a 5x5 slot grid.
- Winnings are calculated based on symbol matches across lines.
- Loop to continuously play until the user quits.

## ðŸ“Œ Game Rules

- The slot machine has 5 rows and 5 columns.
- Each symbol (A, B, C, D) has a predefined frequency and value:
  - A: appears 2 times, value = 5
  - B: appears 4 times, value = 3
  - C: appears 5 times, value = 2
  - D: appears 6 times, value = 4
- You win if all symbols match in a horizontal line youâ€™ve bet on.
