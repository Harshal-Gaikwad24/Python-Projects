# ðŸŽ° Slot Machine Project

This is a simple console-based **Slot Machine Game** built using Python. The project demonstrates core programming concepts such as functions, loops, conditionals, random number generation, and user input handling.

## ðŸ§¾ Features

- Allows users to deposit money.

  - A: appears 2 times, value = 5
  - B: appears 4 times, value = 3
  - C: appears 5 times, value = 2
  - D: appears 6 times, value = 4
